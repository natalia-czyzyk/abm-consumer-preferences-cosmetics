# An agent-based analysis of consumer preferences in the introduction of novel sustainable cosmetics

This repository contains the code, data, and NetLogo model for the master's thesis project on simulating the adoption of sustainable cosmetics using an agent-based model.

## Project Overview

The project is based on a comprehensive literature review and a consumer survey conducted in Poland, with 281 respondents providing insights into their preferences and behaviors related to sustainable cosmetics. Data analysis was performed using Python, and the model was built in NetLogo.


## Key Components

Survey Analysis: Conducted using Python (Pandas), with correlation analysis using Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall methods.

Agent-Based Model: Implemented in NetLogo, allowing customization of product attributes, price, quality, and marketing campaigns.


## Project Structure

All files are stored in the main directory for simplicity.

- **data.csv** – Survey data collected from 281 respondents

- **data_analysis.py** – Python script for analyzing the survey data

- **sustainable_cosmetics.nlogo** – NetLogo agent-based model

- **README.md** – Project documentation (this file)


## Setup and Usage

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.x for data analysis scripts

- NetLogo 6.x for running the agent-based model


## Running the Model

**Data Analysis:**

- Run **data_analysis.py** to reproduce the survey data analysis.


**NetLogo Model:**

- Open **sustainable_cosmetics_model.nlogo** in NetLogo.

- Configure parameters via the interface sliders.

- Run simulations and observe product adoption dynamics.


## Results

The model helps in understanding:

- Influence of product attributes on adoption

- Effectiveness of marketing campaigns

- Dynamics of consumer behavior in the sustainable cosmetics market
